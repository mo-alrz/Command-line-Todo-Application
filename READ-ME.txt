In this project, I tried to write a command-line application for tracking the status
of daily affairs. To achieve this we have to use the sys module from python. The sys module
in Python provides various functions and variables that are used to manipulate different
parts of the Python runtime environment. When you run the application by /python todo.py 
it will show you the options that you can use and how to manipulate the application.

1 - By providing /python todo.py -l you can see the list of the tasks, if the list
is empty, you will get a message and the application will tell you there are no todos, 
It is inevitable that in the beginning, it will be empty and it will send the following 
message.

2 - You can add as many tasks as you usually face in a day and you want to track.
So the application opens the todo.txt file for reading and then takes the task 
and appends the task to the todo.txt. The command for this is:

/python todo.py -a
If you use -a without the next argument it will also provide an error

3 - If you want to delete a task it is fulfilled by the -r argument. It simply takes the 
number of the task that you wish to delete and eliminates it from the todo.txt.The command
for this option is:

/python todo.py -r number_of_task
which should be an integer, otherwise it will provide an error
If you use -r without the next argument it will also provide an error

4 - In the last option, You can tell the application which tasks have been completed by you
and see the list of the completed tasks. The command is:

/python todo.py -c number_of_task
which should be an integer, otherwise it will provide an error
If you use -c without the next argument it will also provide an error
